learning with github
Following the guided tutorial, totaly new to coding, I am however taking a front-end dev class at teamtreehouse currently and thought it would be a good idea to get a start here on github early rather than later. Shooting for a career change to get myself and my family away from the oil and gas industry and computers just seemed like the right fit for me. I am also and avid console gamer who loves his fps games as well as Rpg games.
